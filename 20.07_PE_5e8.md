https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html

# Requirements

## Install Java 8 or later, upto 11

Ref: https://www.nextflow.io/

* Make sure java 8 (or later, upto 11) is installed.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless
```



## Install Nextflow

* Be aware of target folder path in which it includes a special character or a space, it causes an Error. 

```bash
$ java -version
$ sudo curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
$ mv nextflow target/folder/path/
$ cd target/folder/path/
$ ./nextflow run hello
```

## Devlopement logs

Ref: https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html

Nextflow scripting language is an extension of the Groovy programming language.

### Tutorial 1

This is a code in `nextflow/tutorial.nf`:

```java
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

params.str = 'Hello world!'

process splitLetters {

    output:
    file 'chunk_*' into letters

    """
    printf '${params.str}' | split -b 6 - chunk_
    """
}


process convertToUpper {

    input:
    file x from letters.flatten()

    output:
    stdout result

    """
    cat $x | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'
    """
}

result.view { it.trim() }
```

To run this code, there are seveal commands like below:

```bash
./nextflow run tutorial.nf
./nextflow run tutorial.nf -resume
./nextflow run tutorial.nf --str 'Bonjour le monde'
```



### Tutorial 2

Processes are executed independently and are isolated from each other, i.e. they do not share a common (writable) state. The only way they can communicate is via asynchronous FIFO queues, called *channels* in Nextflow.

Any process can define one or more channels as *input* and *output*.

```java
// Script parameters
params.query = "/some/data/sample.fa"
params.db = "/some/path/pdb"

db = file(params.db)
query_ch = Channel.fromPath(params.query)

process blastSearch {
    input:
    file query from query_ch

    output:
    file "top_hits.txt" into top_hits_ch

    """
    blastp -db $db -query $query -outfmt 6 > blast_result
    cat blast_result | head -n 10 | cut -f 2 > top_hits.txt
    """
}

process extractTopHits {
    input:
    file top_hits from top_hits_ch

    output:
    file "sequences.txt" into sequences_ch

    """
    blastdbcmd -db $db -entry_batch $top_hits > sequences.txt
    """
}
```



### Tutorial for Docker

Ref: https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/docker.html

Ref: https://www.docker.com/

It is possible to specify a different Docker image for each process definition in your pipeline script.

```java
process foo {
  container 'image_name_1'

  '''
  do this
  '''
}

process bar {
  container 'image_name_2'

  '''
  do that
  '''
}
```

Alternatively, the same containers definitions can be provided by using the `nextflow.config` file as shown below:

```java
process {
    withName:foo {
        container = 'image_name_1'
    }
    withName:bar {
        container = 'image_name_2'
    }
}
docker {
    enabled = true
}
```



### Configuration: Scope *docker*

The `docker` configuration scope controls how [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers are executed by Nextflow.

The following settings are available:

| Name          | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| enabled       | Turn this flag to `true` to enable Docker execution (default: `false`). |
| envWhitelist  | Comma separated list of environment variable names to be included in the container environment. |
| legacy        | Uses command line options removed since version 1.10.x (default: `false`). |
| sudo          | Executes Docker run command as `sudo` (default: `false`).    |
| tty           | Allocates a pseudo-tty (default: `false`).                   |
| temp          | Mounts a path of your choice as the `/tmp` directory in the container. Use the special value `auto` to create a temporary directory each time a container is created. |
| remove        | Clean-up the container after the execution (default: `true`). For details see: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up—rm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up---rm) . |
| runOptions    | This attribute can be used to provide any extra command line options supported by the `docker run` command. For details see: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/ . |
| registry      | The registry from where Docker images are pulled. It should be only used to specify a private registry server. It should NOT include the protocol prefix i.e. `http://`. |
| fixOwnership  | Fixes ownership of files created by the docker container.    |
| engineOptions | This attribute can be used to provide any option supported by the Docker engine i.e. `docker [OPTIONS]`. |
| mountFlags    | Add the specified flags to the volume mounts e.g. mountFlags = ‘ro,Z’ |
